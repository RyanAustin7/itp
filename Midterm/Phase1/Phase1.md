# Phase 1

I went out of town for Spring Break and left my original sketch that we did in class at home, so I googled virtual graph paper and made a smiley face.

A challenge that might present itself in this task is the curved smile itself, but I wanted to make something that wasn't too easy, while still being relatively simple.
I made a big circle for the head shaoe, 2 smaller circles for eyes, and a curved line for a smile, totaling in 4 shapes.
