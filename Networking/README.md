# Networking Website Documentation File

## My Role:

### For this I was in charge of figuring out how to add the music asset to the website. I pulled a random track I had and then quickly made a new one so we'd have 2 audio tracks. We implemented  "<audio src="name_of_audio_file.wav" controls>" into the code to get the media player to show up. I couldn't remember how to actually get it to use the audio until I heard Rachel say to someone else that it has to be in the actual folder with the .html file, so we did that and it worked! Then we all wrote our bios. We decided to go veggie themed, and we're in an electronic hyper rock crazy music band. I also AI generated the band photo and helped Tim with putting that into the code.
### We adjusted the old Band project's code as a template and went from there. Maya found CSS files for customization and Tim had it on his laptop and dealt with most of the actual implementation and handled the code.
