# Final Project Proposal:
# Portfolio Website!

## Title (probably):
### Ryan Austin Audio

## Summary of Project:
### I want to make a portfolio website using HTML that I can use to network and show off some things I've worked on.

## 3 Resources I will use in development:
### 1. GitHub. I haven't yet used GitHub as a resource for coding but Rachel says it's the place to be so I'll make it happen  
### 2. YouTube  Rachel says this is NOT the place to be but I'm a YouTube addict and get a lot of info from it so I know I'll probably use it.
### 3. Reddit. I'll probably use Reddit and look at what other people have done as well, because I know people on Reddit will have had questions about making a website from scratch using HTML.
### 4. I'll try to avoid ChatGPT but I'll list it as a last resort resource. It's been handy in the past and might save me from any serious pickles I might find myself in.

## Software? Features? How?:
### Software/How: We haven't fully learned the process in class yet but I know I'll be using HTML and that in this next class we'll be talking about websites from the GitHub sites we set up in class last week. So as far as I know in this very moment, I'll be making an html file that is coded to make a page that will be my website and then I'll (probably?) pay for a domain to let it be up and searchable by other people.
### Features: Ideally I would like more than one page. I want a home page with me and some info, and another page with videos of some things I've done and projects I've worked on. I also want links to my socials.

## Good Outcome:
### I'll have a website up with not much on it, maybe a title and a short bio and a picture of me. Some color and things to make it a little less bland.
## Better Outcome:
### I'll have 2 tabs on the website, one that's a home page with info about me and my picture, and another that has a video playing something I've worked on before.
## Best Outcome:
### Both of those combined: I'll have at least 2 maybe 3 tabs, one that's a home page with an About Me and a picture or something, one with a couple videos of things I've done, and maybe another tab for videos of unrelated but still music-related things, like me playing guitar. I also want a link to my Instagram.

## Next Steps:
### The final delivery is due May 7th, that's exactly one month from today. That means I'll spend one week learning HTML more, how people make sites using it, and researching other people that have done it before (YouTube videos, Google searches, ask a friend) just to more familiarize myself with the process and hear others' experiences. The following 2 weeks (April 14th-April 28th) I'll dedicate to getting the website up, AKA accomplishing something between the Good and Better outcome. I'll spend the last week (April 29th-May 6th) refining the website and making it pretty / finding proper material to upload to it before it's officially due. I also imagine that I'll be learning more about this during my upcoming classes, because we're currently talking about HTML, and I also have classmates as a resource which will come in handy. That's my goal!
