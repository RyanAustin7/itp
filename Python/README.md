## Python Reading

### chapter 1: The Way of the Program
- Right off the bat, I didn't know we had to download Python. I just assumed we used python in a software that worked with Python or like Visual Studios or something like that.
- I did know that parenthesis mean that whatever comes before it is a function. I've done a little C# scripting in Unity.

### chapter 3: Functions
- I did not know that functions could convert values of one type to another. However, it doesn't seem to be very accurate or useful, given that it won't round floating point numbers to the appropriate integer, it just chops off the decimal values. And I'm assuming there are moments where we have numbers that are strings instead of float, like in the example, '3.958473' converts to 3.958473, but I don't know when that would be the case. Then again, I get that this is just demonstrating how it works, and there are probably more comlex useful applications.
- I did know the Flow of Execution, or at least parts of it. I knew it read top to bottom and that certain functions can call other functions, and the functions they're calling might not be in order.
- (There was a lot in this chapter that was lost on me, regarding all the math, and bruce)

### chapter 5: Conditionals and Recursions
- I didn't know what a modules operator was, and I like the application of seeing if one number is divisible by another, if x % y = 0. I also did not know the difference between = and ==, that == is a relational operator, and = is an assignment operator.
- I did know about boolean expressions being true or false, as well as conditional and alternative executions.
