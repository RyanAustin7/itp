## Ryan Austin!
I made a playable mini piano (C4 to B4) in scratch.mit.edu.

1.  I found sprites that somewhat closely resembled piano keys and black keys and chose those to work with. I rotated them to be vertical and lined them up next to each other. I changed their color schemes to resemble a piano. I then chose a concert hall background.
2.  I chose a mini crab sprite to be the main character because I thought it looked funny. I then made it possible to move him around the screen using the arrows and if functions. If arrow is pressed, move this amount in the x or y directions.
3.  I went into Logic and played every note in one octave and bounced them all out and used them for the piano key sounds. I made it so if you click on a specific key, it will play a specific note. I also made it so if the crab steps over a key, it plays that note, all using if functions.
4.  When you click the flag, it plays notes. I did this by playing a note if clicked, waiting a fraction of a second, playing another note, etc. It also moves the crab up and down with a thought bubble saying he wants to play too, as I'm assuming the flag will be the first think clicked.
5.  I made a variable called notes. If the crab steps on keys, the variable goes up by one. I fit these in the if statements next to play note. If the variable is equal to 50 (or 51, because sometimes it skips 50 because it counts fast) then it plays a bunch of notes. It kind of sounds like a casino.
6.  If you press spacebar it also plays another jingle.
